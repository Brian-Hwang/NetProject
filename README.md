# NetProject Team 10 - ✨Dodge!✨
2022 Spring Semester Network Project Team#10


## **About the Project:**

✨Dodge!✨ is a online application project based of NS-3, which simulates the network scenario under various topologies for the Dodge game. 
The Dodge game is a game which the player gets to move right or left, to dodge the bricks falling from the sky.
In our project, our own-made AI tries to send the movement control to the server, to show how the outcome differs depending on the different topologies and network throughput.

## **How to Run the Project:**

**All cammands should run under NetProject/ns-allinone-3.29/ns-3.29/
** Prerequisite:
